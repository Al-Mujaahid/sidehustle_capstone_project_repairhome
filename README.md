------------------------------MY MESSAGE TO THE TUTOR
SIR, I FROM THR BOTTOM OF MY HEART, REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR ENDLESS EFFORT IN
TRYING TO IMPACT LIVES FOR BETTER. THE TIME, THE SACRIFICE, THE COMMITMENT, 
REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.
SIR, JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I AM VERY SERIOUS AND COMMITED TO THIS
INTERNSHIP PROGRAMME, BUT CURRENTLY, I AM FINANCIALLY DROWNED TO PAY FOR 
THE BOOTCAMP AND CERTIFICATE. DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY FORM OF SUPPORT FOR 
SOMEONE LIKE ME.
